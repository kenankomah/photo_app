# Photo Gallery app

This gallery app is a project I began for the purpose of teaching my self how to build a fullstack javascript application with a particular empahasis on learning React, Redux, Node and Express.

This is a work in progress so it is far from the finished article, I have detailed below what I have done so far and what I plan to do next.


## What I have done so far

* Set up an Express server
* Used Amazon S3 to store the images
* Set up and connected MongoDB Database
* Used AXIOS and the fetch API to recieve and send data to the back end
* Added Image uploading functionality
* Implemented OAuth logins using Passport.js
* Added Ability to update images with filters


## What I plan to do next

* Create a favourites feature where images can be added to a list of favourites
* Make it a photosharing app with the option to make any image public or private
* Include a feature to allow comments to be added to an image
* Create option to categorise images
